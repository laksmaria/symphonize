        <p>This project is a data generation library for Orchestrate.io services. It can be used locally or as a tool to
            create randomly created data based on configuration into the Orchestrate.io services for testing,
            experimentation or however or whatever you may need data in <a
                    href="http://orchestrate.io/">Orchestrate.io</a> for. For more information on the library ping me <a
                    href="https://github.com/Adron">@adron</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/Adron">Twitter @</a>
            the same.</p>

        <h2>Mission:</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this library is to provide a configuration based way to generate data and get that data into a
            data source, initially that data source is Orchestrate.io.</p>

        <h2>Dependencies:</h2>

        <p>In this project we've used several projects, all available via NPM. These projects include:
            <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/orchestrate" target="_blank">orchestrate.js</a> and <a
                    href="https://npmjs.org/package/chance" target="_blank">chance.js</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Got a Pull Request? Helping Out:</h2>

        <p>
            To help out on the symphonize project I've added the following documentation and issues to that can be
            knocked out pretty easily. As the project moves forward I'll work to keep the issues list stocked with
            appropriate items as they're needed and ready to work on. However, here's a few quick reads before getting
            started.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Adron/symphonize/blob/master/tests/tests.md">/tests/tests.md</a> is a file
                with information around which files include which tests and what the ongoing approach is to writing
                tests against the project.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Adron/symphonize/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> provides a high level
                overview of what the project does (or will do) related to data generation. It provides examples and
                other material as if all of these features are implemented. To see what actually needs worked on and
                implemented however, check out the <a href="https://github.com/Adron/symphonize/issues">issues list for
                    items</a> that are <a
                        href="https://github.com/Adron/symphonize/issues?labels=1+-+Ready&page=1&state=open">ready to
                    work on</a>. For a visual queue of these items check out the <a
                        href="https://huboard.com/Adron/symphonize">Huboard Kanban chart with the list of issues</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Bookmark this <a href="http://adron.github.io/symphonize/">site</a> as it will be the central github
                pages for the project. This is where I'll work to provide all documentation and project information in a
                centrally located place.
